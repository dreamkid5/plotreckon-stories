# Character & visual reference — PlotReckon Stories

Every video renders in one consistent look, matching the reference image you provided:
a **warm 3D animated African folktale**, in the spirit of a Pixar / DreamWorks feature.

## The house style (`folktale3d`)

- **Medium:** 3D animated feature-film still, soft global illumination, subsurface skin
  shading, shallow depth of field. Wholesome and heartwarming, never photorealistic.
- **Light & mood:** bright, warm natural daylight with soft even front lighting, so
  characters are always clearly lit and easy to see (no dark silhouettes or heavy backlight).
- **Setting:** a timeless rural West African village — thatched-roof huts, packed-earth
  paths, acacia trees, gentle green hills under a bright sky.
- **Wardrobe & props:** richly textured handwoven robes, carved wood, leather satchels,
  walking staffs, beadwork.
- **People:** warm dark skin, expressive stylized features, dignified and characterful.

This is set as the default style everywhere:
- Worker / cloud pipeline: `CF_STYLE=folktale3d` (in `worker/.env`).
- In-app Auto Video, Bulk Studio, Video Studio: "African folktale (3D animated)" is the
  pre-selected art style.
- The full keyword lives in `worker/csv.mjs` (`styleKeywords.folktale3d`) — edit it there
  to fine-tune the look for the whole channel at once.

## The signature narrator — the elder griot

The bearded elder in your reference is the recurring storyteller figure. To keep him
identical across scenes, the pipeline uses Claude's **character bible** + **scene matching**
(needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, already set). If you want him guaranteed in a video, name him in
the script and describe him once; the pipeline then redraws him consistently. A reusable
description you can paste into any script:

> **Baba the storyteller** — a tall, lean elderly African man in his seventies, long flowing
> white hair and a full white beard, kind weathered face, deep-set eyes. He wears a rust-brown
> handwoven robe with a cream wrap, a leather satchel and bedroll on his back, and carries a
> polished wooden walking staff.

## Voice

Narration is locked to the free Ava female neural voice
`en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural` via `edge-tts`. No key or cost. See
`worker/SETUP-VOICE.md`.

## Storytime presenter

Each video generates a female presenter portrait for the left side of the
Storytime layout. That presenter stays identical throughout the video and the
exact same portrait is reused on its thumbnail.
